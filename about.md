# About

### What
“$ustain” will be a one day un-conference for open source software sustainers. There will be no keynotes, expo halls or talks. Only discussions and ideas about getting and distributing money or in-kind services to the Open Source community.

### Sustainer?
A sustainer is someone who evangelizes and passionately advocates for needs of open source contributors.

They educate the public through blog posts, talks & social media about the digital infrastructure that they use everyday and for the most part, take for granted.

They convince the companies that they work for to donate money, infrastructure, goods and/or services to the community at large. They also talk to the companies that they don’t work for about the benefits of doing the same things.

### Why
As Nadia Eghbal has reported in “[Roads and Bridges](https://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/): The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure” sustaining our digital infrastructure is a new topic for many, and the challenges are not well understood. This un-conference will bring together those who evangelize and passionately advocate for open source developers' needs.
